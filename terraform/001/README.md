# Crounchynerd - Terraform - Lab 001

This repo contains all labs developed for Crounchynerd demos.

## What is this lab all about?
In this lab we will provision a server automatically in Digital Ocean, configure a apublic SSH Key to access the server and create a A Record binded to the server's IP. Additionally, CloudInit script will install Docker and run an Nginx web server.

## Considerations
- Use your own public SSH Key (you will need your private SSH Key to access the server)
